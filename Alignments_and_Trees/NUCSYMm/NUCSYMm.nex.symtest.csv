# Matched-pair tests of symmetry
# This file can be read in MS Excel or in R with command:
#    dat=read.csv('pcgrnapartition.nex.symtest.csv',comment.char='#')
# Columns are comma-separated with following meanings:
#    Name:    Partition name
#    SymSig:  Number of significant sequence pairs by test of symmetry
#    SymNon:  Number of non-significant sequence pairs by test of symmetry
#    SymPval: P-value for maximum test of symmetry
#    MarSig:  Number of significant sequence pairs by test of marginal symmetry
#    MarNon:  Number of non-significant sequence pairs by test of marginal symmetry
#    MarPval: P-value for maximum test of marginal symmetry
#    IntSig:  Number of significant sequence pairs by test of internal symmetry
#    IntNon:  Number of non-significant sequence pairs by test of internal symmetry
#    IntPval: P-value for maximum test of internal symmetry
